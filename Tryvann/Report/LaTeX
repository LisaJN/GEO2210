\section{Introduction and Theory}
\firstword{T}{he} goal of this project is to examine the properties and variability of snow cover by measuring the depth, density and stratigraphy. The data was collected at Tryvann on the 27th of February 2023 between 9:30-12:00 in the morning. The data sets, additional photos and figures can be found \href{https://github.com/LisaJN/GEO2210/tree/main/Tryvann}{\textbf{here}}, or by copying the link to the repository above. 
Tryvann is at about 504 MOH, which means it gets colder there and the snow cover lasts longer than down in the city. The weather during the week before our trip had been somewhat turbulent as it had first rained, then snowed and then two days before our trip, been very sunny and warm. Therefore we expected some melting in the top cover of the snow pack. 
\section{Study area}
Transect coordinates: 
\newline
59.983152, 10.665676
\newline
59.983275, 10.665311
\newline
The weather that day was very good, it was sunny, with little to no wind and cloudless skies.

\label{fig-1}
\end{figure}
The snow pit originally measured: 83cm, but the actual depth ended up being 62cm. This was due to the snow probe plunging straight through the soft grass under the snow. 
\section{Method}
\subsection*{Instruments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spatula
    \item Measuring tape
    \item Snow probe
    \item Scale
    \item Thermometer
    \item plastic bag, w:2.5g
    \item pen + paper
    \item Shovel
    \item Snow tube, l:19cm, d:6cm
    \item Crystal card
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Measurements}
\subsubsection*{Transect \& snow pit}
We chose a somewhat clear area and used the snow probe to test the depth and chose a place to start digging our snow pit. The profile we were measuring had to be away from the sun, and the snow behind needed to be as undisturbed as possible whilst we were executing the measurements. Then we walked 30m with a measuring tape and used the snow probe to measure depth for each 1m of the transect. 
\subsubsection*{Temperature}
Before conducting the temperature measurements we made a hypothesis of the profile in the snow pack. We thought that it would be coldest in the middle, and warmer at the top, and bottom (warmer closer to the ground than the top). 
\newline
We inserted the thermometer at the bottom of the snow pack and then measured with a 5cm interval to the top. 
\subsubsection*{Density}
For the density measurements we used the snow tube and inserted it vertically from the top down the snow pack until it was completely full. Then we used the spatula to lift it out and into the bag attached to the scale. 
\begin{equation}
    Density = \frac{Mass}{Volume}*1000
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Water equivalents???}
\begin{equation}
    SWE = \frac{1}{\rho _{water}}\int_{h=0}^{H} \rho _{snow} dh = \frac{\rho _{snow mean}}{\rho _{water}}H
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Stratigraphy}
From the previous measurements we had divided the snow pack into clear layers and so we chose to take samples from each of these layers. We used the crystal card to measure the snow crystals from each layer in the snow pack. Each square on the card is $2mm^2$. 

\section{Results}
Include the following data analyses (the exact tasks may vary depending on the snow conditions):
Snow depth: For each transect, estimate the average snow depth x, the standard deviation sx and coefficient of variation $C_v = \frac{s_x}{X}$.

Note: the three other figures are plotted in different plots due to the difference in depth of the snow pack.

\end{figure}
Snow density:
\begin{itemize}
    \item or each sample compute the density = mass/volume. Compute volume from your measurements of the sampling device and express the density in $\frac{kg}{m^3}$. Compute the snow water equivalent SWE, which provides a measure of how much water the snowpack contains. SWE (in m w.e.) is
    computed by integrating the snow density $\rho_snow$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Snow pit}
Here we insert the data collected at Tryvann. 
\section{Discussion}
Where in the snowpack is the most comfortable? The bottom as the middle layer is the coldest and the top layer is dependent on the weather conditions. The bottom layer however is more stable and warmer as the ground heats the layer from below and is not frozen.
 Dette er pga varme fra bakken, pga ikke permafrost. Og ved toppen pga sola og ikke noe/lite vind. 
Om natten kan det hende at det hadde vært kaldest ved toppen, men ikke akkurat nå når vi måler.
More to discuss would be: 
Normally we would have measured a transect before choosing where to dig the snow pit, however as er did not have access to a measuring tape until later, we had to just pick a seemingly good spot and start digging. We, of course, saw later that we ended up with one of the more shallow areas of the transect which is not necessarily ideal. 
\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we can say that blah blah..
